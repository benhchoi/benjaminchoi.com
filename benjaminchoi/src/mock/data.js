  paragraphOne: `I am currently a Software Engineer at Volant Trading, a high-frequency options 
  trading firm. I primarily work with C++ and Python, and touch all software aspects of the 
  system. On any given day, you can find me: implementing new strategies from the ground-up, 
  creating trading apps that interface with FPGA hardware, refactoring hardware-only apps to be 
  software-compatible, automating mundane and previously manual tasks, and providing live support 
  for the system!`,
  paragraphTwo: `I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) Magna Cum Laude with 
  a MS in Computer Science (with a Certificate in Data Mining & Machine Learning) and a BS in 
  Computer Science (with a second major in Economics, a minor in Mathematics, and a Certificate 
    in Financial Economics). While at school, I was an active member of Tau Beta Pi, Zeta Beta 
    Tau, and the university's CSE department.`,
  paragraphThree: `Outside of work, I enjoy tackling new food projects, traveling, Brazilian 
  Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, and yoga!`,

    then be scanned and marked as completed by an instructor via their phone camera or computer.`,

    the classic highway congestion game associated with Braess' Paradox. Results showed the approach converged to
